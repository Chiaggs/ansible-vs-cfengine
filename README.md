# ansible-vs-cfengine
In this project we compared the Continuous Management tools, Ansible and CFEngine. Our findings indicate that though CFEngine is quite an earlier released software compared to Ansible, there are several reasons why Ansible is a more popular choice among users over the years. Thus, we recommend users to thoroughly consider their requirements before selecting one of these tools and considering our personal preference, we would put forward Ansible as a clear winner when it comes to popularity and ease of use.
